/**
 * hb_gpu_draw_shader_source:
 * @stage: pipeline stage (vertex or fragment)
 * @lang: shader language variant
 *
 * Returns the draw-renderer-specific shader source for the
 * specified stage and language.  The returned string is static
 * and must not be freed.
 *
 * This source assumes the shared helpers returned by
 * hb_gpu_shader_source() are concatenated ahead of it.  The
 * caller should assemble the full shader as
 * `#version`-directive + hb_gpu_shader_source() +
 * hb_gpu_draw_shader_source() + caller's `main()`.
 *
 * The vertex stage currently has no draw-specific helpers; this
 * function returns an empty string for that stage so the caller
 * can concatenate unconditionally.
 *
 * Return value: (transfer none):
 * A shader source string, or `NULL` if @stage or @lang is
 * unsupported.
 *
 * XSince: REPLACEME
